    "stakes": "The mercenary company faces winter starvation unless they secure passage and winter quarters, while the defending lord must prove his feudal competence\u2014failure to defend his lands invites future predation and questions his legitimacy among vassals and overlords alike.

    "constraints": "The defending lord cannot negotiate passage without appearing weak to his feudal superiors and inviting future mercenary incursions. The mercenary company cannot retreat without facing certain winter death, eliminating any possibility of tactical withdrawal.",
