    "stakes": "The attackers are a mercenary company that must cross before winter or face starvation. The defenders are local levies protecting their lord's lands. Honor demands the lord's household troops die before yielding, while mercenary brotherhood means they cannot abandon wounded comrades in the crossing.",
    "constraints": "The defending lord cannot appear weak before his vassals and peasants, yet cannot afford losses that would leave his domain defenseless. The mercenaries cannot retreat without facing certain death, but cannot afford a pyrrhic victory that leaves them too weakened to survive winter campaigns.",

Men struck while crossing either drown immediately or crawl to shore with contaminated wounds. Those who survive the crossing face cuts and gashes from melee, but it's the bolt wounds that kill - either quickly from severed vessels, or slowly from corruption. In this era, a punctured lung or belly wound is a death sentence. The real slaughter happens in the water where wounded men simply disappear beneath the surface."
